                        I took a <strong>leading role in the creation of new components and UI elements at SISCOG SA</strong>, which were pivotal in modernizing our applications.

                    <p className="portfolio-description md-bottom">
                        Implementing these components required meticulous attention to detail and a deep understanding of front-end technologies such as Angular and modern web programming languages. 
                        <strong>Weekly meetings were held during these component creations</strong>, where we conducted tests with the testing teams and gathered insights from various stakeholders to determine the best possible approach to the component implementations.

                    <p className="portfolio-description md-bottom">
                        One of the most challenging aspects was designing the components without significantly altering the initial component ideas. Since the software was old and many users were accustomed to its interface, we had numerous baselines and constraints.
                        Finding a sweet spot between design and programming was challenging, but <strong>being positioned between the two teams allowed me to provide valuable insights and learn from both sides</strong>. This process involved iterative development cycles, 
                        where I refined designs based on user feedback and usability testing to achieve optimal results.
